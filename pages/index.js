        <h2>Andromeda</h2>
        <p>Several centuries from now humanity has developed the faster than light drive and spread
            through much of the Milky Way Galaxy. For over a century humanity has been at war with various
             extraterrestrials as it struggles to expand its territory. As resources were consumed at ever 
             increasing rates it became evident that if humanity desired to continue this expansion, or to 
             even hold its ground, new technologies would be required.
        </p>
        <p>Enter the intergalactic warp rail. Warp rail technology was about 2 generations old, and widely
             regarded as commonplace. It catapulted a ship several lightyears nearly instantaneously, trading 
             speed for a bit of inaccuracy for the shift back to real space. Several mega corporations worked 
             together to build a warp rail several orders of magnitude larger than the ones used for conventional
             travel. This warp rail was intended to send small amounts of material to the nearby Andromeda Galaxy 
             to build a return warp rail, and the infrastructure needed to send supplies back to the Milk Way.     
        </p>
        <p>You have made the trip from the Milky Way and have just arrived at the Andromeda Galaxy hoping to make
            a name for yourself. A whole new galaxy awaits with vast opportunities and exciting adventures to be had. 
            Perhaps you will help maintain humanities foothold by ferrying vital supplies to outposts and the few military
             fronts that have developed. Perhaps you will mine resources to be made into useful equipment such as ships, ammo,
             or the components to build items. Perhaps you will work with one of the corporations who built the 
             warp rail to build their items and develop new cutting edge variations of their current catalog.
        </p>

        <p>This website serves as a repository of items in the game, how they interact, the skills that you can master,
             and the corporations that you will interact with in the Andromeda Galaxy.
